    title: "Global Tensions Escalate as Military Activity Increases Across Regions",
    summary: "Rising geopolitical tensions spark global concerns, with increased military deployments and strained diplomatic relations.",
    category: "Policy",
    content: "Global tensions have intensified as major powers increase military readiness across multiple regions. NATO has strengthened its eastern defenses, while diplomatic talks remain stalled. Analysts warn that prolonged escalation could disrupt global trade and energy markets. Global geopolitical tensions have entered a critical phase as major powers increase military deployments, signaling a shift from strategic caution to active preparedness. The expansion of defense infrastructure by NATO in Eastern Europe, combined with naval activity in contested waters, reflects a growing concern over regional stability turning into broader conflict. Diplomatic channels remain open but strained. Negotiations mediated by the United Nations have yet to yield concrete de-escalation measures, while sanctions and counter-sanctions continue to intensify economic friction between nations.From an economic perspective, global markets are reacting sharply. Investors are shifting toward safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds, while equities—especially in energy and defense sectors—are showing increased volatility. Supply chain disruptions are becoming more pronounced, particularly in energy exports, semiconductor production, and shipping routes.Cyber warfare has also emerged as a silent but powerful front. Governments report increased cyberattacks targeting financial systems, infrastructure, and communication networks, indicating that modern conflict is no longer limited to physical battlegrounds.",

    summary: "The Reserve Bank of India maintained its benchmark repo rate at 6.5%, citing persistent inflation concerns and global headwinds.",
    category: "Finance",
    content: "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday decided to hold its key lending rate steady at 6.5% for the eighth consecutive meeting, as it weighs persistent inflationary pressures against slowing global growth. Governor Shaktikanta Das emphasized the need for vigilance on food price volatility while acknowledging the resilience of domestic economic activity. The decision was widely anticipated by market participants, though some had hoped for a surprise cut given recent softening in core inflation metrics. Bond yields remained largely unchanged following the announcement, while equity markets showed modest gains. Analysts noted that the RBI's forward guidance suggests any rate action is unlikely before Q3 2026, with the central bank preferring to wait for more clarity on the monsoon season and its impact on food prices.",

The $15 billion project, a joint venture between Tata Electronics and TSMC, aims to produce chips at the 28nm node initially, with plans to scale to 7nm within five years. Prime Minister Modi called it 'a historic step towards Atmanirbhar Bharat in technology.' The facility is expected to create over 20,000 direct jobs and spawn an ecosystem of ancillary suppliers.

Key highlights include a reduction in corporate tax for MSMEs from 25% to 22%, a new Production-Linked Incentive scheme for the electronics sector worth ₹50,000 crore, and increased allocation for national highways by 30%. The budget also introduced a Digital India Innovation Fund of ₹10,000 crore to support AI startups. Markets reacted positively, with the Sensex climbing 800 points in intra-day trade. However, economists flagged concerns about the fiscal deficit target of 4.5% of GDP, suggesting it may be challenging to achieve given the expanded spending plans.",
